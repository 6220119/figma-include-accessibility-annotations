## Intro

<img alt="plugin version 0.1.0" src="previews/include_banner.png" />

The eBay Include accessibility annotation Figma plugin is a tool to make annotating for accessibility (a11y) easier — easier for designers to spec and easier for developers to understand what is required.

The plugin was developed by members of the accessibility and design teams at eBay and is released for public use on Figma. You can view and install the latest version of the plugin [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1208180794570801545/Include%3A-an-accessibility-annotation-tool).

## Installation

```
npm i
```

## Development
