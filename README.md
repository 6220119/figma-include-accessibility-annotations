## Intro

<img alt="plugin version 9" src="previews/v9/include_banner.png" />

The eBay Include accessibility annotation Figma plugin is a tool to make annotating for accessibility (a11y) easier — easier for designers to spec and easier for developers to understand what is required.

The plugin was developed by members of the accessibility and design teams at eBay and is released for public use on Figma. You can view and install the latest version of the plugin [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1208180794570801545/Include%3A-an-accessibility-annotation-tool).

## Installation

```
npm i
```

## Development

```
npm run dev
```

To open **Inspect mode**

<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>

With the iframe of web app in a Figma plugin, hot-reloading doesn't really work, so to re-start the plugin quickly:

<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>

To open the plugin in development mode on Figma, map the manifest file at the root of this project.
